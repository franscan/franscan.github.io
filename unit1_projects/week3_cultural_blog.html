			<h1>Cultural Blog: Week 1<h1>
			<h2>Release 1</h2>
			<p>After seeing Shereef's Fireside chat, what we were initially told about DBC is confirmed and developed. It is not traditional education but a sort of open source learning. Yeah you pay for it, but it is up to you what you do with what you bought. You can leave it as is, you can just add couple of things for it suit your basic needs, you can tweak the hell out of it and put dogs that sneeze candy and balloons all over the place. I think this is a great approach, but one you need to be really conscious of or it will pass you by. And I think that's something that happened to me these last three weeks. I have seen what the work actually is and that has not changed my expectations but made some of them very real and palpable. Sacrifices stopped being an idea in my head and have become daily things.</p>

			<p>Probably like most, I grew up in a very typical educational structure, and I never really dove and questioned teachings and tried to make things a two way street, except if I had a personal bone to pick with a certain teacher. The fact that I'm not a spotlight lover didn't help and I ended carrying this beahviour to my career. So the reality is that I'm not really used the kitchen mentality and that will probably will take some extra effort to overcome and get used to. However, everything DBC has given us to check on the human side either I had read/watched something similar or it resonated with me. Empathy, taking advantage of our time, tailoring our education, mindfulness, they are all things I have been chasing but haven't really been able to incorporate fully into my life. So this tugs strongly on me, I am done being idle and not engaging. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this will be tough growth for me, but this kind of environment is where I want to live and thrive, so I WILL learn the kitchen way.</p>
		
			<p>Based a bit on what I said before, the natural result is that this kind of learning environment makes me both excited and nervous. I feel like standing with a glider on the edge of a cliff. I know it is going te be awesome but that cliff looks insanely deep, can't help but getting that know in my stomach. Something that came up for me was a new fear which is not the greatest thing to happen but let's better be honest. At one point Shereef mentioned some people are invited to do Phase 1 again and if I was in that group, it would not be a good thing. Since I am in a more difficult position to get a job in the US, being Argentinian and non citizen, I took time off work instead of quitting. And this cohort is the only one that fits time wise, I fly out immediately after it finishes as a matter of fact. Therefore, I will be doubling down the effort! Code on!</p>
