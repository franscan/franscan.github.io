			<h1>Technical Blog: Week 2. .</h1>
			<p> This time around we were asked to explore the reasones as to why Javascript is so popular. Having lurked through the web a bit, these seemed to be the common denominators:
<ol>1) It is easy to learn.</ol>
<ol>2) Libraries: these are a collection of prewritten sets of code available to the coder in any program he develops, saving a great amount of time.</ol>
<ol> 3) Reduced server load and increased speed. Javascript runs on your browser so less interaction with the server is needed which in turn increases speed.</ol>
<ol>4) Widespread functionality. Pretty much every computer comes preloaded with some form of Javascript and pretty much every browser runs some version of it.</ol>
<ol>5) If you choose to, you can also run Javascript server side.</ol>
<ol>6) Some point also to Google and their use of Javascript in their AJAX implementation over gmail and gmaps as the starting point of its revival and thriving.</ol></p>
